# Validations

Of the following HTTP status codes, which is the most appropriate to return if a
model's data is not valid?

## Correct

422 (Unprocessable Entity)

> Right! To quote the [spec
> ](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918#section-11.2): The 422
> (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the content type
> of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct, but was
> unable to process the contained instructions. There are some [differences of
> opinions on this ](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20215807)

## Incorrect

418 (I'm a teapot)

> This is an actual status code that was created for an [April Fool's joke
> ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418)!

## Incorrect

500 (Internal Server Error)

> 500 Internal Server Error indicates that "something went wrong on the server",
> typically because of a runtime error on the server itself. You shouldn't return
> this status code from any controller actions directly.

## Incorrect

404 (Not Found)

> This error indicates that the record itself wasn't found, not that the model's
> data was not valid.
