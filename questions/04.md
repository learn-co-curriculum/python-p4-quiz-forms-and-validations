# Validations

Which of these validations is most appropriate for making sure that a
model's **title** is at least 20 letters long?

## Correct

```python
@validates('title')
def validate_title(self, key, title):
  if len(title) <= 20:
    raise ValueError("title must be 20 letters.")
  return title
```

> Right! `len()` is helpful for checking the length of an attribute.

## Incorrect

```python
@validates('title')
def validate_title(self, key, title):
  if len(title) != 20:
    raise ValueError("title must be 20 letters.")
  return title
```

> Not quite! Let's look at the validation logic how would we check if a string is
> at least 20 characters long?

## Incorrect

I don't know
