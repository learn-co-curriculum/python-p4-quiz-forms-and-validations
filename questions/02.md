# Validations

What does the key represent in the validate\_email method?&nbsp;

```python
@validates('email', 'backup_email')
def validate_email(self, key, address):
    if '@' not in address:
        raise ValueError("failed simple email validation")
    return address
```

&nbsp;

## Correct

It represents which column the validate\_email method is running on in case we
are validating multiple columns with one function.&nbsp;

> Bingo! The key is how we determine which column is being validated so we can
> know what conditions we need to apply to the column.&nbsp;

## Incorrect

The key represents the primary key value for the row.

> Not quite! The names can be confusing but the key in this context has a
> different meaning.&nbsp;

## Incorrect

I don't know
